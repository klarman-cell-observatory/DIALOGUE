# **Welcome to the DIALOGUE!**

DIALOGUE is a dimensionality reduction method that uses cross-cell-type associations to identify multicellular programs (MCPs) and map the cell transcriptome as a function of its environment. Given single-cell data, it combines penalized matrix decomposition with multilevel modeling to identify generalizable MCPs and examines their association with specific phenotypes of interest.
